HOW TO RUN THE WEB APPLICATION:
1.Navigate to the EnterpriseHackaton folder in cmd line
2.Activate the flask environment which is done by typing in the following commands:
  source flask/bin/activate
  set FLASK_APP=run.py
  set FLASK_ENV=development
  flask run

REMARK: by using the 'flask run' command, you are running the application on the default port 500.
